# What is this?

> "What the heck is this for?"

Well, you see, I have an interest in creating things and in writing. I'm clearly not very
_good_ at writing but it's an interest nonetheless. I have a number of ideas floating
around in the jelly blob that sits between my... ears ...but nowhere to actually put them.
Enter this website. It will serve as a method for me to explain and flesh out some of my
ideas while also being a fun little side project for me to scratch the itch to create.
Additionally, I recently built a new computer and decided to run Arch on it instead of
paying for another Windows key. This has been a major impetus for me to actually start
work on this website.[^ooc-note]

# Self-Confidence

> "Mayhaps you've noticed... I have none!"

One of the major things that I was to work on is my self-confidence. I don't know if this
site will help do that but I do know that the catharsis of watching text in an editor
become something beautiful (well, functional at the very least :wink:) is something that I
find to be very fulfilling. I'm hoping that, with something fun to actually show on my
CV, I'll be more open to exploring options.

# Desire

> "For a long while, I've _wanted_ to make something..."

I have had a strong desire to make some kind of program or another for a long time...
Eh, years, at this point. It's something I used to be decent at but my skills have
atrophied significantly. While this little project doesn't help with my main goal of
re-initializing my ability to make nifty applications, it does help me get back into the
mindset required to think logically and solve problems. I'm looking forward to where this
project will take me.

##### Conclusion

Sometimes... You just have to do something in order to get something done.
Here's to a lovely project and something to think about for a good while to come.

[^ooc-note]: Eventually, I will have myself a fancy-pants wrapper for these out of
    character (OOC) posts. I haven't even started to think about touching that portion of
    the process yet, though, so have a standard-looking post!
