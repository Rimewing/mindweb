Greetings!
It's nice to see you here, thank you for checking in!

It's been a bit since I have posted anything on the Mindweb but rest assured, I've been doing well!
There are a number of little things that I have been working on recently, from getting my Audible
downloads and converting them from the native .aacx file format into .m4b so I can listen to them at
work to grabbing a new neovim configuration set up. I'll put the more technical aspects of these up
in dotfiles at some point (I'm still working on the posts) but I'll go over a bit of the trial and
error involved with these processes after I go through the personal stuff.

## Mentality and Hatchdays

I am, for the most part, a solitary creature. I check in with Sylvio daily and there are the daily
dinner-time chats that happen with those whom I share a lair. Outside of that, however, I am quite
happy to simply keep to myself and engage with the things that I enjoy doing. Sometimes this
includes interacting with others but most often, it's something that I've hyperfocused upon. There
have been four of such things since the last time I posted to the Mindweb: Solo-Leveling, Tower of
God, Chorus of Dragons, and Dragon's Dogma 2. I'll get into these after this!

Also, I recently celebrated my hatchday; though, to be honest, those aren't much more than a typical
Tuesday. I don't generally care for the fanfare and celebration that most others do... My hatchday
is generally a day I prefer to spend taking care of myself. That said, thank you to all the friends
who sent their well-wishes along!

I've been struggling a bit with melancholy, lately, things outside of my hyperfixations have been
feeling rather... daunting. It might be from a lack of sleep, honestly. (Did I mention that hyperfocusing on
something is generally disastrous for one's sleep schedule? No? Well, let it be known... Spending
two weeks of your life getting 3-5 hours of sleep each night isn't particularly healthy. I would not
recommend it.)

### Solo-Leveling
> `ARISE`

This is like... the grandfather of the isekai genre. It's not _really_ isekai but it fills a similar
sort of style. I'll not get into too many spoilers here because I highly suggest you take a look at
this on your own and make your own memories of it. It's a lovely, cohesive story with a good, sturdy
ending that was satisfying. Again, I highly recommend taking a look at the manhwa if you get the
chance to do so.

### Tower of God
> The 25th Bamm knockin' it out of the park!

I spent about two weeks straight reading this manhwa and the entire thing was hyperfocused beyond
any expectation or proper ability to control. I don't think I've been as frustrated with a
hyperfixation as I was with this one--not because it was a bad read or story but because it was 'my
kind of story' and I literally could not get it out of my head. Also, it's long. I don't read slowly
but this thing took forever to get through; there's a lot of material. It's available online and,
like Solo-Leveling, I would highly recommend reading it if the first season of the anime grabs your
attention.

### Chorus of Dragons
> Relos Var is a bastard.

This is a lovely little set of books by Jenn Lyons. Starting with _'The Ruin of Kings'_, the series
follows a boy who's the reincarnation of a big spooky and his struggles to overcome those who would
use both him and the big spooky to do dispicable things. The story is somewhat gritty and is not at
all what I would consider 'all smiles.' The ending is fairly predictable if you're paying attention
to the story but it has a sort of subversion of the typical 'character with god-like power can do
whatever they want' and, for that, it's a refreshing story. I wouldn't say the ending is exactly
happy but it's definitely not a 'bad guy wins' ending. The story swaps point of view with each
chapter and it's told 'after the fact' -- where the major events of the story have already happened.

### Dragon's Dogma 2
> The Neverending Ring supports another cycle...

DD2 is not as good as the original was, in my opinion. That said, it was still a fun game and it did
enough to occupy the vast majority of my attention. I ended up at level 80 or so by the time I
finished the Unmoored World. The story was not much of a departure from the first game's and you
know the premise of the game before you start it -- if you've played the first. The main story is
supposed to be short because you're supposed to play it in a series of cycles... I.E. the
Neverending Ring. The vocations for this game are all very good at what they were designed to do.
I will, however, mention that I absolutely HATE the `Trickster` vocation; it's focused upon supporting
the pawns but I am definitely not the kind of player who enjoys 'minion builds' and that is what
Trickster leans into. Similar to the first game, my favorite vocation for Dragon's Dogma 2 is
going to be `Warrior`. Sorry but I just love the BIG SWORD (or mace, depending on the enemy).
